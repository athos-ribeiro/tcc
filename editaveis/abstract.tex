 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

   Due to the constant evolution of Software Engineering, each day brings
   new programming languages, development paradigms, forms of
   evaluate processes, among others. With the metrics of source code doesn't
   be different, with the passage of time arise a number of new metrics and
   the use thereof has the need to know why and how the
   uses them. For the use of any metric software,
   it is necessary to have knowledge about how to perform the collection, calculation,
   interpretation and analysis for decision making. In the context of metrics of
   source code, collecting and calculating most often are automated by
   tools, but how to interpret them and analyze them correctly in
   software development cycle? This work aims to try to
   help the Software Engineer to interpret and track metrics
   source code in addition to the design, which are already quite consolidated. It have
   initial focus of vulnerability metrics of source code.
