 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

   One technique to reduce the number of vulnerabilities found in software is
   the detection and resolution of flaws present in the source code.
   The detection of these flaws may be automated with source code security
   static analysis tools. This work presents an approach to evaluate source
   code security static analysis tools, since the selection of the tools being
   evaluated to the presentation of the evaluation results. Later, it presents
   usage examples for the proposed approach, the ability of some Free (as in
   freedom) static analyzers to detect infinite loops and the soundess of the
   analysis of a tool that claims to be sound are evaluated.
